/**
* GraphHopper Directions API
* You use the GraphHopper Directions API to add route planning, navigation and route optimization to your software. E.g. the Routing API has turn instructions and elevation data and the Route Optimization API solves your logistic problems and supports various constraints like time window and capacity restrictions. Also it is possible to get all distances between all locations with our fast Matrix API.

/// Isochrone Request
/// The GraphHopper Isochrone API allows calculating an isochrone of a locations means to calculate 'a line connecting points at which a vehicle arrives at the same time,' see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map). It is also called **reachability** or **walkability**. 
///
/// @param point Specify the start coordinate
/// @param key Get your key at graphhopper.com
/// @param timeLimit Specify which time the vehicle should travel. In seconds. (optional) (default to @600)
/// @param distanceLimit Specify which distance the vehicle should travel. In meter. (optional) (default to @-1)
/// @param vehicle Possible vehicles are bike, car, foot and [more](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/supported-vehicle-profiles/) (optional) (default to @"car")
/// @param buckets For how many sub intervals an additional polygon should be calculated. (optional) (default to @1)
/// @param reverseFlow If &#x60;false&#x60; the flow goes from point to the polygon, if &#x60;true&#x60; the flow goes from the polygon \&quot;inside\&quot; to the point. Example usage for &#x60;false&#x60;&amp;#58; *How many potential customer can be reached within 30min travel time from your store* vs. &#x60;true&#x60;&amp;#58; *How many customers can reach your store within 30min travel time.* (optional) (default to @(NO))
/// @param weighting Can be fastest or shortest (optional) (default to @"fastest")
